secret_word = "thunder"
guess = ""

while guess!= secret_word:
    guess = input("enter guess: ")

print("You Won!")


above allows for infinite guesses
below set up a guess limit

guess = ""
guess_count = 0
guess_limit = 5

while guess != secret_word and not(out_of_guesses):
    if guess_count < guess_limit:
        guess = input("enter guess: ")
        guess_count += 1
    else:
        out_of_guesses = True

if out_of_guesses:
    print('Out of Guesses, You\'ve Lost!')
else:
    print("You Won!")
